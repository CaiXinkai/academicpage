I am a Master's student at the School of Life Sciences, [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/ ). My research interests encompass bioinformatics and computational biology. During my undergraduate studies at [the Center of Genomics and Biotechnology](https://genome.fafu.edu.cn/ ), Haixia Institute of Science and Technology, [Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University](https://www.fafu.edu.cn/ ), I focused on multi-omics analyses and evolutionary genomics. I am currently based at the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Drug Target Discovery, where I apply computational approaches to dissect the roles of epigenetic regulators in cancer and to facilitate rational drug design.
