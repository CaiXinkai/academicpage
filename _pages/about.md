I am a Master's student at the School of Life Sciences, [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/ ). My research interests encompass bioinformatics and computational biology. During my undergraduate studies at [the Center of Genomics and Biotechnology](https://genome.fafu.edu.cn/ ), Haixia Institute of Science and Technology, [Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University](https://www.fafu.edu.cn/ ), I focused on multi-omics analyses and evolutionary genomics. I am currently based at the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Drug Target Discovery, where I apply computational approaches to dissect the roles of epigenetic regulators in cancer and to facilitate rational drug design.

# Highlight research  
Identification and characterization of _GRAS_ genes in passion fruit (*Passiflora edulis Sims*) revealed their roles in development regulation and stress response  

# Independent scholarly project
<p>A Study on Potential Therapeutic Targets for Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) Based on GEO Database Analysis</p>
<p>Structure-Alignment-Based Drug Screening and Docking of the AcrB Transporter</p>
<p>Multidimensional Dissection of the V-ulence Mechanism, Regulatory Circuitry, and Evolutionary Trajectory of <i>Halomonas elongata</i> Hemolysin A (TlyA)</p>
