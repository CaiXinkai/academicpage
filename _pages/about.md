I am a Master's student at the School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University (https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). My research interests encompass bioinformatics and computational biology. During my undergraduate studies at the Center of Genomics and Biotechnology, Haixia Institute of Science and Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, I focused on plant multi-omics analyses and evolutionary genomics. I am currently based at the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Drug Target Discovery, where I apply computational approaches to dissect the roles of epigenetic regulators in cancer and to facilitate rational drug design.
